# SmartPark
Data collecting 

The purpose of Smart Park is to give users some suggestion about how many parking lots are available 
on campus to make life easier. To achive this goal, we design an app on the phone (both android and iOS) 
to collect the data to help us make a judgement what the state of movement of users, e.g. walking,driving,
or standing. The state of movement of user is related to sensors in the phone, e.g. accelerometer,gps,
gyroscope,magnetometer.Based on the meachine learning idea, we can predict what the user will do so that 
we can give proper suggestion to user.
